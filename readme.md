## Description
This repository contains a deep learning model designed for activity recognition, leveraging time-series data from smartphone sensors. The model classifies various types of human activities by analyzing acceleration and rotation data captured by smartphones' built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes. This approach aims to provide real-time, accurate activity classification, such as walking, running, sitting, and more.
